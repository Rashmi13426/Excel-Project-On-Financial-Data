# Excel Project on Financial Data

## Project Overview

This Excel project focuses on **financial data analysis and interactive dashboards** to provide insights into sales, profit, and product performance across different countries, segments, and time periods.
The goal is to simplify decision-making by summarizing large datasets into actionable visual reports.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key columns:

* **Calc Profit, Calc Sales, Calc Gross Match, Calc Gross Sales, COGS, Discount Band, Manufacturing Price, Sales Price, Units Sold, Consistency between month, number, and name, Country, Year, Quarter, Month, Day, Product, Segment, Month Name, Month Number, Gross Difference, Months, Profit Difference, Product & Year Concatenation**

---

## Data Preparation

Several calculated columns were added for data consistency and deeper analysis:

* **Profit Check:** Verified as `Profit = Sales - COGS`
* **Sales Calculation:** `Sales = Gross Sales - Discount`
* **Profit Difference:** `Profit Difference = Profit - Calc Profit`
* **Concatenated Column:** `Product-Year = Product + " " + Year` — for easier cross-reference in pivot tables.

---

## Pivot Tables Created

1. **Sales by Country and Year** – Breakdown of total sales per country across years.
2. **Profit by Segment and Product** – Profit performance segmented by business segment and product type.
3. **Monthly Sales Trend** – Tracks sales evolution over time (Month Number and Month Name).
4. **Top 5 Products by Sales** – Highlights the highest-performing products in terms of total sales.

## VLOOKUP Implementation

A **VLOOKUP** formula was used to fetch the **Sale Price** based on the *Product-Year* lookup value.
This demonstrated how to efficiently reference specific product-year combinations from a sales dataset.

| Lookup Value     | Sale Price |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Paseo - 2013     | 15         |
| Paseo - 2014     | 350        |
| Carretera - 2014 | 7          |
| VTT - 2014       | 300        |

**Formula Used:**

```excel
=VLOOKUP(A2, LookupTable!A:B, 2, FALSE)
```

## How to Use

1. Download the Excel file.
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab.
3. Use the interactive slicers to filter data.
4. Explore pivot tables directly for deeper insights.
